<HR>


<p>This sample was contributed by <a href="mailto:aasif@khi.compol.com">Asif Rasheed</a></p>

<p>Here is an implementation of my WinInet wrapper class. This small application serves
two purposes,

<ul>
  <li>There are some ISPs who disconnect the connection if the client is idle for a particular
    time. This application makes it busy. User only have to adjust the time at which it
    iterates it attempts.</li>
  <li>It can be used for monitoring the HTTP service on a particular server either it is
    working or not. If HTTP service stops due to any reason it start the beeping.</li>
</ul>

<p>The application was written using MFC 4.2 and Visual C++ 5.0,&nbsp; It uses 

<ul>
  <li>WinInet class wrapper</li>
  <li>CTrayIcon class by Chris Maunder. </li>
</ul>

<p>I am releasing this app into the public domain with no restrictions.</p>
